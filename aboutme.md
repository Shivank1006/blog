Hi, I am pursuing my Bachelors of Technology from the Indian Institute of Technology Ropar. I am majoring in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science & Engineering.

My interests include Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Data Structures and Algorithms. I love solving real-life problems using coding and machine learning. I recently started writing a blog to share my learnings in various courses that I am taking here at IIT.

I am currently exploring Open Source and wish to contribute to open source projects.

This blog is mainly to share my learnings in various courses that I am taking here at IIT.
